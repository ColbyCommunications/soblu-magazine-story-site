                                The Colbyettes, the Megs, Broadway Musical Revue (BMR)—Amina
                                McIntryre ’04 had auditioned for all of them but hadn’t been
                                selected. In a conversation at the SOBHU room, she discovered she
                                wasn’t the only one in that situation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With that realization came an idea: the friends would start their
                                own group.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In March 2002, seven women—Alice-Marie Allen ’04, Nadra Crawford
                                ’05, Rharaka Gilbert ’05, Amina McIntyre ’04, Melissa Minaya ’03,
                                Betsy Ramos ’04, and Chyann Oliver ’04, all but one in SOBHU—started
                                E.V.E., or Ethnic Vocal Ensemble, which is currently called
                                Everything Vocal Ensemble.

                                “We had an open concert in the coffeehouse,” said McIntyre,
                                recalling that they sang four or five songs that night. “We did a
                                mixture of things.” They sang songs in different languages, Alicia
                                Keys songs, and sometimes mixed them with poetry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From there on, the group took off. “We started out with seven
                                people; next year we had like 14,” she said.

                                The Echo reported on their success with a story on Sept. 5, 2002:
                                “These girls blew everyone away, new and returning students alike.
                                They approached a cappella in a new way by incorporating poetry into
                                their performance, which was set to the theme of love. They
                                impressed the audience with their delightful renditions of Maxwell’s
                                ‘Drowndeep’ and Alicia Keys’s ‘Jane Doe.’ They also received the
                                only standing ovation of the night after they performed Nelly
                                Furtado’s ‘I’m Like a Bird.’”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In another story from Sept. 12, 2002, the founding members shared
                                details of their formation. “It was a joke at first,” Oliver told
                                the <em>Echo</em>, adding: “It’s a blessing in disguise that all of
                                us didn’t make the other a cappella groups; though it is kinda
                                strange to think. This way, we wouldn’t have been able to come
                                together like this.” Their name choice, they explained, was chosen
                                because it captured their musical selections and styling. “Ethnic
                                does not mean that it has to be a person of color. Ethnic is just
                                soulful singing,” said Ramos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “We literally started out [with] one white woman and all the rest of
                                us were Black and Hispanic,” McIntyre said. “It came out of SOBHU
                                because we weren&rsquo;t seeing our kind of songs, we weren&rsquo;t
                                carrying our voices, and we didn&rsquo;t have a place to sing
                                because we weren&rsquo;t getting accepted into a lot of the groups.”
